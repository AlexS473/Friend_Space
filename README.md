# Web_Final
This repository was created to keep my Web Programming and Technologies 1 Final Exam Safe. 
Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic or Exam became a 2 day assignment. 

### The Main Tasks
We were tasked with a very simple social media flask app. I called mine FriendSpace. 

Here the login page design:
